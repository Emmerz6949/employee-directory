# Employee Directory

## Description

This repository was created so I could create an employee directory React application that allows users to sort the employees alphabetically and reverse alphabetically by first name via the up and down arrow heads beside the word "Name", and to filter the employess by first name, last name, or email via the search bar.

You can use the commits to follow my journey.

### How did I do it?

I used JavaScript, JSON, JSX, the React.js framework and its many default dependencies, and the following additional installed via npm Node.js packages: "axios", and "bootstrap" to write my code. I also used an installed via npm Node.js package called "gh-pages" to deploy the website.

If you wish to visit this website you can do so via this link: https://emmerz6949.github.io/employee-directory/ .



### Installation

If you wish to fork this code for your own use, then make sure you have Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. And after you've cloned or downloaded your forked repository use the command "npm install" in the terminal to install all the necessary packages (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file). After that, if you have everything installed, you simply have to have your terminal in the same direcetory as mentioned in the previous sentence and use the command "npm start" to run it. It should automatically open up a new "localhost:3000" tab in your default browser to access the application when it's ready.



### Usage

To use this employee directory React application click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md. Once the website loads use the up and down arrow heads beside "Name"to sort the employees by alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order, or use the search bar to filter the employees by their first name, last name, or email address.
